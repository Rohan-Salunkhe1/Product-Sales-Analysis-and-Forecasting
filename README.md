# Product Sales Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Overview
In this project, I will analyze **product sales trends** from a dataset spanning **April, May, and June 2022**. The objective is to:
- **Explore key sales trends** for different product categories.
- **Identify correlations between price, delivery type, and fulfillment status.**
- Use **forecasting techniques to predict sales and optimal pricing** for future quarters.

The tools used include **SQL for querying** and **Google Sheets/Excel** for visualizing data trends and performing forecasts, along with minimal **Python** for additional forecasting if needed.

## Data Summary

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains **19 columns**, each providing crucial information about sales, customer orders, and delivery outcomes. Below is a breakdown of how Iâ€™ll leverage the key columns:

| **Column Name**       | **Use in Analysis**                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order ID              | Identify unique orders to track cancellations and successful sales.|
| Date                  | Extract **month and quarter** for time-based analysis.             |
| Status                | Analyze **delivery success vs. cancellations.**                    |
| Fulfilment            | Compare orders fulfilled by **Merchant vs. Easy Ship.**            |
| Sales Channel         | Evaluate sales trends across **Amazon and other channels.**        |
| Category              | Group and analyze sales for **different product categories.**      |
| Qty                   | Track **sales quantity** trends over the three months.             |
| Amount                | Measure **total revenue** generated by each product category.      |
| Currency              | Confirm currency consistency for **INR** transactions.             |
| Ship-city/state/postal-code | Perform **regional analysis** to see how location impacts sales. |
| Courier Status        | Assess **delivery timelines and shipment performance.**            |
| B2B                   | Determine how **business-to-business (B2B)** sales contribute.     |

## SQL-Based Exploratory Analysis

### 1. Monthly Sales Performance by Category
This query analyzes total **sales and quantity sold** per product category across April, May, and June 2022.

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DATE) AS month,
    category, 
    SUM(amount) AS total_sales, 
    SUM(qty) AS total_quantity 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY month, category
ORDER BY month, total_sales DESC;

SELECT 
    category,
    fulfilment, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status LIKE '%Cancelled%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cancelled_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN courier_status LIKE '%Delivered%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_deliveries 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY category, fulfilment;

SELECT 
    category, 
    AVG(amount) AS avg_price, 
    SUM(qty) AS total_quantity 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY category;

=FORECAST.LINEAR(13, B2:B12, A2:A12)
